************ROADmap*****************

Level 1: Foundations & Setup
Goal: Get the TS compiler running, grasp the core type system, and write your first typed scripts.

Environment & Tooling

Concepts:

Installing TypeScript (npm install -D typescript)

tsconfig.json basics: target, module, strict flags

Practice:

Scaffold a bare‑bones project, compile hello.ts → hello.js

Tweak strict options and observe compiler errors

Primitive Types & Variables

Concepts: string, number, boolean, any, unknown, void, null/undefined

Practice:

Write functions with explicit return types

Swap any ⇒ unknown, force type‑guards



Interfaces & Type Aliases

Concepts: structural typing, interfaces vs. aliases, optional/readonly properties

Practice:

Model a User object, consume it in functions

Extend interfaces, intersect type aliases

Summary & Key Wins

TS installed and configured

Solid grip on primitives, strict checking

Defined and extended simple object types




Level 2: Functions, Generics & Inference
Goal: Master function signatures, unleash generics, and lean into TS’s inference engine.

Function Types & Overloads

Concepts: typed parameters, return types, optional/rest parameters, function overloads

Practice:

Build a calculate overload for add(a,b) vs. add(a,b,c)

Enforce strict null checks in callbacks





Generics 101

Concepts: generic functions, interfaces, constraints (T extends …)

Practice:

Create a wrap<T>(value: T) utility

Build a generic Repository<T> interface for CRUD ops




Type Inference & Contextual Typing

Concepts: how TS infers types from usage vs. annotations

Practice:

Remove explicit types and let TS infer

Use as const and see literal inference




Summary & Key Wins

Typed your entire function layer

Built reusable, generic utilities

Trusted TS inference to reduce boilerplate




Level 3: Advanced Type System
Goal: Deep‑dive into union, intersection, mapped and conditional types for rock‑solid type­safety.

Union & Intersection Types

Concepts: discriminated unions, tag‑based narrowing

Practice:

Model a Shape = Circle|Square and compute area with exhaustive checks





Mapped & Conditional Types

Concepts: Partial<T>, Readonly<T>, custom mapped types, conditional (T extends U ? X : Y)

Practice:

Implement a DeepReadonly<T>

Build a PickByValue<T, V> that picks props matching a value type






Utility Types & Index Signatures

Concepts: built‑in utilities (Record, Exclude, Extract), dynamic keys

Practice:

Create a Config = Record<string, string> and transform it




Summary & Key Wins

Crafted powerful, DRY type transformations

Ensured exhaustive checks and zero‑runtime surprises

No more “any” ghosts lurking in your code










Level 4: TS in the Wild (Frameworks & Ecosystems)
Goal: Embed TS into real‑world stacks—React, Node.js, tooling pipelines—and ship production‑grade apps.

TypeScript + React

Concepts: TSX, React.FC<Props>, useState<T>, context typing

Practice:

Convert a small React component library to TSX

Enforce strict typing on props and hooks

TypeScript + Node.js / Express

Concepts: typing req, res, middleware, .d.ts declaration files

Practice:

Spin up a typed Express CRUD API

Write a custom type declaration for a third‑party lib

Toolchain Integration

Concepts: ESLint with @typescript-eslint, Prettier, Babel vs. TS‑only builds

Practice:

Add lint/prettier CI checks

Configure incremental (--incremental) and watch mode

Summary & Key Wins

Seamlessly integrated TS into front‑ and back‑ends

Automated your code quality pipeline

Reduced runtime bugs by catching them at compile time




































🟢 LEVEL 0: Kickoff - JavaScript to TypeScript Mindset Shift

Basic Functions with TS

💡 Practice Tasks:
Convert simple JS file to .ts (e.g. calculator, string reverse)

Annotate function parameters + return types

Play with any vs unknown – observe behavior
